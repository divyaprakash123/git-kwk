<h1>About Me!</h1>
<p>My name is Divya Prakash! I am a student who just graduted with a B.S. in Computer 
    Science and Public Health, with a minor in International Relations. When I am not designing a robot system or churning out code, you can
    find me taking film and digital photos of my friends, making matcha,
    building legos, or curating my newest spotify playlist!  :)    
</p>

<p> I love matcha & making different types of it at home 🍵
    I love traveling and have spent most of my summers at the beach 🌊
    My favorite disney movie is big hero 6 because i love robots 🦾
