        Hi! My name is Divya Prakash. I recently graduated with a B.S. in Computer 
        Science and Public Health, along with a minor in International Relations.
        When I'm not designing robotic systems or writing code, you’ll probably find me 
        capturing film and digital photos of my friends, making matcha, building LEGOs, 
        or curating my latest Spotify playlist. :)
    </p>

    <p>
        Some fun facts! -->
        I love experimenting with different ways to make matcha at home 🍵.  
        I enjoy traveling and have spent most of my summers at the beach 🌊.  
        My favorite Disney movie is <em>Big Hero 6</em>—because I absolutely love robots! 🦾
